Data Mining assignment - Flight Delay Prediction


Flight delays are very crucial during decision making progress of every commercial airline player and are quite frequent. Delay is the most important performance metric for any commercial transport system, in context of air transportation systems it is represented by difference between scheduled and real times of departure or arrival of a plane. There are a lot of factors considered by country regulators on subject to delay of a flight, like weather, and a multitude of indicators. These delays lead to frustration to the passengers, as we will see the data present in the United States. The objective of this paper is to perform analysis on the historical flight data present and build a predictive model to predict if the given flight will be delayed or not with respect to certain characteristics. The predictive model built will help the passengers as well as the airline to predict the future delays and to minimize them.
